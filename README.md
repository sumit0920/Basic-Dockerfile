## How it works

1. **FROM alpine\:latest** â†’ starts from a lightweight Linux base image.
2. **CMD \["echo", "Hello, Captain!"]** â†’ sets the default command to print the message when the container runs.

---

## Optional: Push to Docker Hub

1. Login:

```bash
docker login
```

2. Tag your image:

```bash
docker tag hello-captain your-dockerhub-username/hello-captain
```

3. Push it:

```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/hello-captain
```
